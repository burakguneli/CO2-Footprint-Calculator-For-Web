    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>
      This is a totally unaccurate carbon emission calculator. Help us to make it more accurate: <a href="https://github.com/burakguneli/CO2-Footprint-Calculator-For-Web" target="_blank">Github</a>
    </p>

    <h2>How it works?</h2>

    <p>
      Using browser API's, extension gets total transfer size and "guesses" emitted CO2 according to total transfer size of the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are using word "guess" because it's nearly impossible to measure carbon emission just using transfer size data. This extension accepts that 1 MB transfer emits 0.003 kilograms of CO2.
    </p>

    <h2>I Want To Reduce My Emission, What Should I Do?</h2>

    <p>
      If you are not a web developer, unfortunately there isn't much to do with this extension on your end. You can just use this extesion for fun. Maybe you can go and plant a tree. I don't know, I'm just a developer :)
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are a web developer, you can calculate how much your app emits CO2 and you can try to reduce transfer size of your app. Also you can always contribute to this <a href="https://github.com/burakguneli/CO2-Footprint-Calculator-For-Web" target="_blank">project</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>TO-DO</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Find a way to calculate emission on pages which use socket</li>

      <li>If website fetchs data with workers, we can't gather transfer size amount. Find a way to get transfer size for those pages</li>

      <li>Don't calculate CO2 emission if current site is "green hosted"</li>

      <li>Make a better detail page</li>
    </ul>
